# Sharing Is Caring

[sic] has goals of being a multi-social network feed collector allowing user control of the feeds content. 

Right now it's a Bitchute client that can also access Youtube for legacy support of that cousin that is really important to you but will never abandon their 23 followers on archaic platforms. Still filling out the scaffolding from the proof of concept release. Hoping to have beta functionality and release by september.

Should have some form of working Webtorrent sharing by beta

Thanks so far

https://jsoup.org/ for their great html/xml parsing library
https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html for their player which provides 110% of the solution I was looking for

Software being developed and built in Android Studio
