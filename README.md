Sharing is caring has goals of being a multi-social network feed agregator allowing the user to control his feed and not a corportaion or government.

Right now it's a Bitchute client that can also access Youtube thanks to VLCs many great features. No internal video player, but designed to leverage the capabilities provided by other media players
VlCs ability to lock the screen, play in pop-op, and play in background mean in several ways this is a superior youtube client than their free service.

Right now the bitchute videos are playing from their streaming hosting, but using webtorrents is high on the list of features to be implemented
Fediverse and other network integration as well as some sort of local networking like scuttlebutt

So far it's a couple weekends worth of work. Hope to have something usable in a month. The code will be going through a lot of changes before then so not looking for help there yet, but the XML isn't something that I'm good at and it could use a lot of work, so help there is always welcome.
